# Crowdfunding

## kickstarter

> Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that allows individuals to raise funds for creative projects such as films, music albums, art installations, and technology products. Project creators set a funding goal and a deadline, and people can pledge money to help bring the project to life. In return, backers often receive rewards such as early access to products, exclusive merchandise, or behind-the-scenes content. Kickstarter operates on an all-or-nothing funding model, meaning projects only receive funds if they reach their target goal by the deadline.

Users create campaigns with specific goals and share their stories to seek financial support from friends, family, and the general public. Unlike some other crowdfunding platforms, GoFundMe operates on a flexible funding model, allowing campaign creators to keep any amount of money raised, regardless of whether the goal is met.

##  AngelList
